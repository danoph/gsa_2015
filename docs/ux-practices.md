User Experience/Design Practices
================================

_Note: while we have split these brief in-depth descriptions of our practices into "software development practices," "quality assurance practices," and "user experience/design practices," these distinctions are made here more for organizational clarity than to be truly descriptive or representative of the way we think about software development, as no one piece could function properly without the other(s). Design, development, and quality assurance are all important pieces of our process throughout the entirety of a project's life-cycle._

Our success with delivering the best possible functional design and user experience (UX) stems from two primary areas: skilled designers and environment. Each member of our design/user experience team goes through a stringent certification program for usability analysis and interaction design. Each designer is responsible for introducing elements of the user experience process such as card sorting, task flow analysis, prototyping, and usability testing to every project at Asynchrony. 

 All of our designers/UX experts are embedded into the project team. This ensures that good design and user experience are woven into the fabric of the developing application from start to finish. It is expected that our designers are part of the QA process, as each UI (user interface) story makes it through development, prior to customer demonstration. 

For most projects, our designers and UX experts are leading usability testing sessions and incorporating that end-user feedback into the designs. We employ any number of strategies and methods, including wire-framing, prototyping, and usability testing, to ensure that our designs are not only functional and easy to use, but also meet customer and user expectations and deeds.
